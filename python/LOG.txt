Potential todos for next release

General:
- Save output information when an analysis is run so the results can be replicated
- Migrate to a pure Python approach (reimplement the matlab core SAA function to python)
	- Include a mapping function to represent ordinal variables
For matlab part:
- Improve MATLAB-Python communication
- Change to Object-Oriented programming (OOP) for the MATLAB modules: "prepare data" and "extract and decode data"
